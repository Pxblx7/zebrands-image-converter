# Zebrands Image Converter - An Interactive Case Study

This repository contains the source code for an interactive webpage that serves as a case study for the development of the "Zebrands Image Converter," an internal tool built through AI collaboration.

The page itself is a demonstration of how product vision and AI-driven development can create high-quality, engaging digital experiences.

## üöÄ About The Project

This project was born out of a real business need: an efficient, secure, and cost-effective way to convert images to modern web formats (.WebP) for web optimization.

This interactive case study documents the journey of creating this tool, led by a Product Manager (Pablo Arroyo) with no coding background, in under two hours. It highlights:

- **The Problem:** The limitations of existing free tools and the high cost of paid platforms.
- **The Journey:** A two-phased approach, starting with a prototype from Gemini and evolving into a professional application with Vercel V0.
- **The Power of Iteration:** How product management expertise guided the AI to refine UI/UX, fix bugs, and add enterprise-grade features.
- **The Final Impact:** A tool that saves time and money, built with zero engineering resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This interactive webpage was built using modern, lightweight web technologies:

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for all animations and interactive elements

## ‚ú® Key Features of the Case Study Page

- **Interactive AI Conversation:** Simulate the iterative dialogue between the Product Manager and the AI to see how the tool was built.
- **Dynamic Animations:** Scroll-triggered animations and animated statistics bring the story to life.
